# userscripts
A collection of useful userscripts

## Usage
You must have a Userscript manager and [Shinigami Eyes](https://shinigami-eyes.github.io/) installed for the scripts to work. I recommend Tampermonkey.

### cleanup_twitter.js
Automatically censors anti-LGBT, pro-conservative and political in nature Tweets from appearing on your timeline and ruining your day ([since Elon changed the algorithm](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change))

Utilizes the brilliant [Shinigami Eyes](https://shinigami-eyes.github.io/) extension to filter out and block tweets and a fallback regular expression based matcher.
